### Hi, I'm Kristen (she/her) 👋🏼

**KristenBalisi/KristenBalisi** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Currently, I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My passion lies in exploring human-centered design and leveraging technology to provide meaningful solutions to real-world problems. In my free time, you will often find me reading, listening to podcasts, or trying my hand at new baking recipes!
